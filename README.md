# Freelance Marketplace Data Analysis

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of freelancer performance across popular freelance platforms including Fiverr, Upwork, and PeoplePerHour. The aim of this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shohinurpervezshohan/freelancer-earnings-and-job-trends) is to uncover meaningful patterns and insights into how factors like job completion, client satisfaction, marketing efforts, and hourly rates influence a freelancer‚Äôs overall success.

Using Python's data analysis and visualization libraries, we explore trends in freelancer behavior, identify what contributes most to earnings, and create custom performance metrics to quantify efficiency, return on investment, and client relationships.

## üîç Project Objective

Freelancing has become a key pillar in the modern workforce. With thousands of freelancers offering services globally, platforms collect vast amounts of performance data. This project uses that data to answer questions such as:

-   What contributes more to freelancer income: hourly rate or number of jobs?
    
-   Does marketing investment lead to higher earnings or better ratings?
    
-   How do platform choices and payment methods impact job success?
    
-   Are client satisfaction and rehire rate correlated?
    
-   Do expert freelancers actually earn more per job than beginners?

## üìà Key Insights

-   **Job Volume > Hourly Rate**  
    The number of jobs completed showed a stronger correlation to total earnings than hourly rate. High-volume freelancers on Fiverr earned more than low-volume experts on other platforms.
    
-   **Client Satisfaction Drives Loyalty**  
    Rehire rate strongly correlates with client rating, suggesting that building relationships leads to recurring income.
    
-   **Marketing Spend Doesn't Guarantee Success**  
    High marketing spend did not consistently lead to higher ratings or earnings. In some cases, freelancers with low marketing investment achieved better ROI.
    
-   **Hourly vs. Fixed Projects**  
    Fixed-price projects were generally completed faster and more efficiently, while hourly projects correlated more with higher client ratings and rehire rates.
    
-   **Platform Behavior Varies**  
    Fiverr supports high-volume beginner freelancers, while Upwork tends to reward more experienced professionals with higher hourly rates and earnings per job.
